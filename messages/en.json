    "processTitle": "Process-Production of Ceramics",
    "processText1": "At the beginning, the clay is properly homogenized by kneading it for at least three minutes, like pizza dough. We make sure that there are no air pockets in the clay, as these explode during the bisque firing (first firing) and may also destroy other works.",
    "processText2": "The prepared clay can now be shaped using different techniques (pottery, table building). There are no limits to creativity and wonderful works are created every time, which then have to dry at room temperature for at least 5-7 days before they are bisque fired at approx. 900 degrees. Takes a total of approx. 48 hours with the cooling phase before the works can be removed from the kiln again. Now the works are ready to be glazed (painted). Different techniques can be used depending on the desired result to achieve exciting goals. The glaze works in the kiln at over 1000 degrees and therefore has a life of its own, which always surprises us ceramicists. Therefore, there are also important points that must be observed when glazing.",
